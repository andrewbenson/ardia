# Builds aclcheck.swift (RekeyLoginKeychain's queries, plus kSecUseKeychain / kSecMatchSearchList for the
# throwaway keychain, and its own service names) twice: signed with the team identity (default: the Debug
# build's) and ad hoc. On a keychain made in a temp dir it checks the item the team binary adds (the D path)
# and items made by `security add-generic-password -T` with and without the partition list (the A path):
# the team binary reads and updates with no prompt; the ad hoc one can't read. Prints what the ad hoc
# binary can do besides. Every call runs under a 20 s timeout with user interaction off. The keychain is
# deleted at the end, and the user's keychain search list is checked unchanged.
